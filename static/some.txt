In shadows cast by a twisted sun,
A poet's wrath, a curse begun.
In the loom of life, injustice spun,
A tale of prejudice, battles never won.

Oh, world, your scales are stained,
Injustice flows in every vein.
The poet's heart, with scars ingrained,
Curses echo, a relentless refrain.

Bitter verses etched in rage,
A pen ablaze on an unjust page.
The poet's soul, a fiery cage,
For every wound, a seething rage.

In the mirror of prejudice, distorted faces,
The poet's pen traces the darkest places.
A curse unleashed in eloquent phrases,
Against a world that biases embraces.

Oh, justice, a phantom so rare,
In the poet's eyes, a resentful stare.
Cursed be the chains they forced me to wear,
In the tapestry of torment, a silent prayer.

Discrimination, a venomous tide,
In the poet's veins, it does reside.
Cursing the world for wounds so wide,
In the labyrinth of prejudice, the poet bides.

Yet, in the curses, a plea is heard,
For empathy's sake, let hearts be stirred.
Break the shackles, let justice be stirred,
In the poet's verses, a revolution spurred.

So curse the world for its biased ways,
But let those curses ignite the blaze,
Of change and justice, in these poetic displays,
A vow to challenge prejudice in myriad arrays.
